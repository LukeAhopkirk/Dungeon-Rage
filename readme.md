# Dungeon Rage

Dungeon Rage is a top-down shooter with a fantasy theme, created over six weeks during a summer school course on Unity. This project taught us game design from the ground up, and we’re proud of how it turned out. Try out the game here: [Dungeon Rage](https://cosc360.otago.ac.nz/games/2024/DungeonRage).
